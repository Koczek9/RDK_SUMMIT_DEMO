In Vagrant there is default mount directory: hosts directory where "Vagrantfile" is stored will be bind-mounted into "/vagrant" inside VM.
This can be used to moving files in/out of the VM. So any new file created/moved to Vagrantfile directory should be visible in "/vagrant" and other way around.

The files don't always show up instantly. You may need to use "vagrant halt" and "vagrant up" to restart the VM. The files should then be visible in "/vagrant".

Known bug: For some reason sometimes in Fedora VM this default bind-mount doesn't work as it should. If that happens and you cannot move files in/out of VM you can use vagrant scp (https://github.com/invernizzi/vagrant-scp) instead.
